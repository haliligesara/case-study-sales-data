The solution of the case for all the included points (except dbt) comes in a Jupyter notebook, in python. Please make sure you already have installed python, in my case Python 3.9.6, so the requirements.txt does not cause any conflicts. 

Use a virtual environment, run the requirements.txt and then execute the notebook, step by step or all at once. Since the notebook is large and includes everything (code, comments, explanation of data quality issues, data integrity assumptions, analysis results, star schema approach), I suggest going through it cell by cell.

Thank you and I hope to hear from you again!
